# Hi there, I'm Leela Krishna Sai 👋

I'm a Data Science graduate student at the University of Michigan–Dearborn with a strong foundation in machine learning, NLP, computer vision, and statistical analysis. I love turning messy, real-world data into meaningful insights and building intelligent systems that actually help people make decisions.
